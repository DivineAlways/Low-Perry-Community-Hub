*Note: This styling assumes Marimo notebook supports standard markdown features. Some elements might need adjustment based on specific Marimo capabilities.*

You can further customize this by:
1. Adding interactive code cells
2. Including collapsible sections
3. Adding custom CSS if Marimo supports it
4. Including visualizations or diagrams
5. Adding interactive buttons or widgets
