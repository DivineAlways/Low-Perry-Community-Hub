## 💡 Reusable Prompt for New Ideas
> Generating innovative solutions aligned with existing capabilities.

```python
# Prompt Template
domain = "Web3"
tools = ["Hardhat", "Thirdweb"]
metric = "reducing time-to-deploy"
area = "interactive development"
benefit = "cost reduction"

prompt = f"""Imagine enhancing our workflows in {domain}. Considering our current tools like {tools}, propose innovative solutions or integrations that can:
1. Improve efficiency by {metric}.
2. Expand our capabilities in {area}.
3. Provide measurable benefits in terms of {benefit}.

Generate actionable steps to implement these ideas."""
